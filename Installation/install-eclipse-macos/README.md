To use Eclipse for Java programming, you need to first install JDK. Read "How to install JDK for macOS".

To install Eclipse:

Goto http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/package/. Choose "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" and "macOS x86_64" (for Intel processor). You will receive a DMG file (e.g., "eclipse-java-202x-xx-R-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.dmg").
Double-click the downloaded Disk Image (DMG) file. Follow the screen instructions to install Eclipse. Eclipse will be installed under "/Applications/eclipse". (To confirm!)
